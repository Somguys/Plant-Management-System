# My Personal Project

## Plant Management system for your favourite virtual garden

A virtual *manageable plant* system:
- This application will allow users to create plants <br> from a list of available plants 
- Each plant will have unique features and belong to a specified category of type, and <br> require special care
- User can water the plants, place in the sun or periodically move plant from an outdoor garden <br> or to indoor garden for special care purposes
- plants will either grow or die depending on the <br> **conditions created and managed by the user**


The purpose of this project is to create a fun and engaging plant management system. And allow the user to be engaged in
caring for the plants created and nurtured by the User. 


## User Stories 
 
*Phase 0*:<br>
In the context of my plant management system:<br>
Users can create plants and name them.
PLants will start to decay immediately after being created and have a starting health of 100.
Users can add plants to a garden which will have a slow decay rate, but still decay.
Users can water plants to keep them alive by choosing the plant they want to water.

Advanced: 
Users can create plants from a list of available plants displayed to the user<br> 
in the UI. Then the user can place the plant in several gardens that have different characteristics <br>
Such as, temperature, rain exposure, bug exposure, rain exposure.<br>
The user will have to decide which environment will best fit the plant. <br>
The plants will either start dying or grow based on the conditions.

To create the plants, I will code the classes in Java to give their unique characteristics. <br>
And the plants will be placed in several gardens. These will be list <Plant> and <br> also have altering characteristics <br>
that affect the livability of each plant, based on their type and individual characteristics.
